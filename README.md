### Hi I'm Johan Rosenkilde

I'm a Research Engineer at [GitHub Next](https://next.github.com). 
See my [profile on GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/team/johanrosenkilde/) 

I started at GitHub March 2021. Before that I was a academic researcher in algorithms for algebra for about 10 years, most of this time spent at the Technical University in Denmark ([Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?hl=en&user=d8AVunIAAAAJ)).

the greater Copenhagen area of Denmark to be slightly more precise. It's a great place and I can take a short walk down to a beautiful nature reserve.

I mix working remotely and going to the very nice Microsoft Lyngby office.

- ‚ö° Fun fact:

I love paper crafting ‚úÇÔ∏è, and used to run a [small company producing artsy "julehjerter"](https://johansjulehjerter.dk) (woven Christmas hearts) which is a type of decoration everyone in Denmark hangs on the Christmas tree.
