I'm a founding AI engineer at [XBOW](https://xbow.com). I'm one of the main architects of our "solver", the piece of software that sits around our LLM interactions, providing steering and carrying out the model's instructions.   

Until April 2024, I was a Research Engineer at [GitHub Next](https://next.github.com). I was the third engineer on what became GitHub Copilot. I also co-built the original Copilot CLI, and was involved in several other exciting projects (e.g. [SpecLang](https://githubnext.com/projects/speclang/) and [Copilot NES](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-next-edit-suggestions/).

Before joining GitHub in 2021, I was an academic researcher in algorithms for algebra for about 10 years, most of this time spent at the Technical University in Denmark ([Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?hl=en&user=d8AVunIAAAAJ)).
