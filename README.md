### Hi I'm Johan Rosenkilde

I'm a Research Engineer in the [Office of the CTO (OCTO)](https://octo.github.com) in the Code Intelligence team.

I started March 2021. Before that I was a academic researcher in algorithms for algebra for about 10 years, most of this time spent at the Technical University in Denmark ([Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?hl=en&user=d8AVunIAAAAJ)).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

shhh, it's a secret...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Everything GitHub - there's a lot to take in!

- I live in 🇩🇰 ...

the greater Copenhagen area of Denmark to be slightly more precise. It's a great place and I can take a short walk down to a beautiful nature reserve.

I mix working remotely and going to the GitHub Copenhagen office.

- ⚡ Fun fact:

I love paper crafting ✂️, and used to run a [small company producing artsy "julehjerter"](https://johansjulehjerter.dk) (woven Christmas hearts) which is a type of decoration everyone in Denmark hangs on the Christmas tree.
